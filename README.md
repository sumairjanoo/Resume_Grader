Resume Analysis and Grading Tool
📄 Overview
The Resume Analysis and Grading Tool is a Python-based application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to evaluate resumes against job descriptions. It provides a "fit score" based on keyword matching, readability, and relevant skills, helping job seekers enhance their resumes and recruiters streamline their screening process.

🎯 Key Features
Keyword Matching: Extracts key terms from job descriptions and matches them against resume content to identify relevant skills.
Readability Scoring: Uses the Flesch Reading Ease score to evaluate the readability of resumes, ensuring clear and effective communication.
Fit Score: Generates a final score by combining keyword relevance and readability, offering a quantitative measure of how well a resume aligns with a job description.

📚 How It Works
Text Preprocessing: Resumes and job descriptions are preprocessed to remove special characters and stop words for effective keyword extraction.
Keyword Extraction: The tool identifies the most relevant keywords in the job description and compares them with those found in the resume.
Readability Analysis: Calculates the Flesch Reading Ease score of the resume to measure its complexity and readability.
Scoring: The final fit score is computed using a weighted average of keyword relevance and readability scores, providing an overall assessment of the resume's fit for the job.

💡 Why This Tool is Useful
For Job Seekers: Quickly analyzes resumes to highlight areas for improvement, helping tailor them to match job descriptions effectively.
For Recruiters: Automates the tedious task of manual resume screening, making it easier to identify suitable candidates based on their skills and the readability of their resumes.
For Students: Offers an easy way to optimize resumes for specific job applications, increasing their chances of landing interviews and job offers.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language for building the tool.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Used for text preprocessing, keyword extraction, and scoring.
Libraries: nltk, textstat, collections, and re for various NLP tasks and readability analysis.
